Image captioning AI enables transforming the visual information of images into machine-readable language.

By transforming visual data into text, image captioning AI paves the way for deeper content discovery, engaging social media presence, and efficient data management across various fields.

The Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP) model can perform various multi-modal tasks, including image-text retrieval and image captioning.

Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows you to build a demo or web application for your machine-learning model or a Python function. Gradio supports various inputs and outputs, such as text, images, files, and more.

In this module, you worked on a project for building an AI that analyzes images, generates descriptions, and creates a text index for them. This project involves:

Implementing an image captioning tool using the BLIP model from Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers.

Using Gradio to provide a user-friendly interface for our image captioning application.

Adapting the tool for real-world business scenarios, demonstrating its practical applications.
